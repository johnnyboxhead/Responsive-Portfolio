                <p>
                    I'm a fun loving and hard working guy from Richmond, VA.  I was born and lived 
                    in the Hopewell/Prince George area of Virginia for my first 20 years of life 
                    on this planet.  I lived in and attended school in Hopewell, which is a small independent 
                    incorporated city in central Virginia.  I played sports and from time to time excelled in 
                    school but didn't achieve anything spectacular, even in a small community. One huge part of my 
                    upbringing was spending time on my Grandmother's/Great Uncle's farm in Prince George where 
                    I spent the summers baling hay, fixing fences, and whatever other hard labor I could be 
                    subjected to.  Those times helped create my strong work ethic, fostered a love of animals, and 
                    gave me a deep appreciation for the subtle beauty of nature; things that I carry with me to this day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started my professional career in 1998 with Capital One, at the time a small but 
                    promising credit card company that had recently spun off from Signet Bank.  The job
                    and hours were less than ideal but it was a way for me to get my foot in the door.
                    I started off taking phone calls and did so for the next eight-ish years, getting several 
                    promotions and moving to different departments along the way.  In 2004 I decided to make a change at 
                    Capital One and moved to our Bank, which was a small startup at the time.  Once in the Bank
                    I started to progress and now 14 years later I'm leading a team that supports our Bank
                    contact centers in trying to help customers with our self-service offerings.

                <p>
                    At times I'm still shocked that an unremarkable guy from a no-name town has been able
                    to achieve what I have.  I work for a Fortune 100 Company (as of 2017) and have driven
                    initiatives that have somehow touched the lives of millions of our customers.  I'm very 
                    appreciatiave for all the opportunities I've received and try to always stay humble, realizing
                    that a huge part of my success is due to people who have believed in and helped me along
                    the way.  I look towards the future with a clear heart and an open mind and hope that the 
                    second half of my career is as surprising and fun as what I've expereinced so far.
